# Python String and Boolean Operations

This repository contains a collection of simple Python programs that demonstrate basic operations with strings and boolean values. 
The purpose is to show how to manipulate strings and booleans efficiently, allowing users to interact with the program to perform transformations and comparisons.

## Features
The code contains the following programs:

1. Convert string to uppercase
Function: to_uppercase(word)
Description: Receives a string and converts all letters touppercase.
Input: A word.
Output: The word in uppercase.

2. Convert string to lowercase
Function: to_lowercase(full_name)
Description: Receives the user's full name and converts allletters to lowercase.
Input: Full name.
Output: Full name in lowercase.

3. Remove leading and trailing whitespace from a phrase
Function: remove_whitespace_start_end(phrase)
Description: Receives a phrase and removes any whitespacefrom the beginning and end.
Input: A phrase.
Output: The phrase without extra spaces.

4. Separate day, month, and year from a date
Function: separate_day_month_year(informed_date)
Description: Receives a date in the format "dd/mm/yyyy" andseparates the components: day, month, and year.
Input: A date in the format "dd/mm/yyyy".
Output: A dictionary with the day, month, and yearseparated.

5. Concatenate two strings
Function: concatenate_strings(string1, string2)
Description: Receives two strings and concatenates theminto one.
Input: Two strings.
Output: The two strings concatenated.

6. Invert a boolean value
Function: invert_bool(input_value)
Description: Receives a boolean value and returns theinverted value.
Input: A boolean value (True/False or 1/0).
Output: The inverted boolean value.

7. Compare two numbers
Function: compare_2_values(num1, num2)
Description: Compares two numbers provided by the user andreturns True if they are equal, or False otherwise.
Input: Two numbers.
Output: True if the numbers are equal, or False if they aredifferent.
